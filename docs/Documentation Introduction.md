This is the introduction to the Cob project documentation.

The documentation is written in the markdown language, with the documents suffixed with '.md', and should be read with the Obsidian editor, as some files include Obsidian links and were formatted in Obsidian only. If not possible, the documents can be opened in any markdown or text editor.

The documentation is divided into sections and sub-sections, represented by folders with files. Sections represent logically related groups of documents relevant to the product.

Different sections are intended for different audiences - business, users and developers.

For ease of use, some documents contain Obsidian links to sections in other relevant documents.

**For relevant information on how to write new documentation, consult [[Documentation standard and formatting]]**

For the purposes of the documentation, the terms *product* and *project* are used interchangeably, with *product* being used when being referred to in business and end-user relevant info, and *project* for developer documents.
