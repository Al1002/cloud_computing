#TODO: linear - plan project based on old one, plan build pipeline
Agile:
As a software developer,
i want a cloud environment to build my aplications in,
so that i can run them remotely in isolation.


Strategy:
 auto-build, , auto-test. No exceptions
 segregate parameters from code. nothing is hard-coded, nothing is assumed
 documentation - assume someone who hasnt seen a computer is reading this.
	because that someone will be you in 3-5 days.
	KISS (keep it simple, stupid!)
	- Also, keep it central. if i want to find out what the endpoints are,
	i should be able to do that in 10 mins or less

 modularized functions - do things via functions, keep them segregated
 in modules. a function inside a module need not provide redundant information
 regarding its work within the module

 unit test with 80% coverage, end-to-end test with 100% coverage

 related: pre-commit hooks - figure shit out

 commits: touch at most 1 module and its tests. if you must touch 2 modules-
	make 2 consecutive commits

 there exist 3 things: the code, the docs, the auto-test/build pipeline(s)

Management: linear

Docs: obsidian documents in the github repo
Epic: An app that can handle multiple users doing CRUD operations.
An ability to monitor and control their project instances via CRUD.
User data validation.

GIT, Obsidian (docs), linear app, env - VScode, pre-commit
