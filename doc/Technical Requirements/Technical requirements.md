**Deploy** - the service should be like cattle - simple to deploy, easy to shut down/remove.

**Configure** - the service should be customizable and parameterized as best it can.

**Add-ons** - the service should be able to accept pipelines for different languages, as long as they conform to a certain interface.

**Scale** - the service should be able to handle many instances of many projects of many users. It should be resource-bound, not software-bound.

**End user interface** - the service does not need to provide the user with a GUI. It is raw endpoint only.
