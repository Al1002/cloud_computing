This is the master document for writing and managing documentation for the Cob project. Consult this file if you wish to better understand the structure of the documentation or to write new documentation.

Below is described what common rules the documents should follow.
## Sections
As described in [[Documentation Introduction]], the documentation is to be divided into sections of related, relevant documents. These documents should be created and formatted for use within the Obsidian editor. 

Sections may have a document titled '(Section) Introduction' to explain what documents or sections can be found within the section.

## Descriptive names
The full path of a document should deliver the entire context necessary to understand what it describes. When deciding, redundancy should be chosen over avoiding repetition. 

This does not cover obtuse names. Names should require as little prior knowledge to the project as possible, unless A) stated otherwise or B) its is unreasonable to give such names.

After that, each document should also include in its first paragraph a brief of what it documents. This information should be redundant with its path - it should give the full context of what the file documents without prior knowledge of the reader unless stated otherwise.

## Formatting
This section concerns the formatting of the text within the documents. 
## Headings
Headings are to be of type 2. Sub-headings (i.e sections within other sections) may either use smaller headings (type 3) or another distinguishing marker (such as ALL CAPS, **bold**, or horizontal rules (---))
