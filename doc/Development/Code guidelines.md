A function may not be bellow 5 rows, unless its a method.

A function may not be above 30 rows.

Any piece of code may not have indentations above 3.

```
0 indent
	1 indent
		2 indent
			3 indent!
				4 indent!!!
```

This is prevented with early returns and function simplification

A class may exist if and only if it stores at least 2 pieces of data.

If you cant come up with a rational, sane-sounding name for something, dont do it.
